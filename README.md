# Bilal Web App

White-label installment-sales platform for a Lahore appliance business.

## Current state

Phase 0 (codebase cleanup and baseline) is implemented on branch `phase0-codebase-cleanup`.

The repository is **not production-ready yet**. Later phases cover authentication/session hardening, persistent media, product/category CMS, financial integrity, customer isolation, analytics, SEO/AEO/GEO, structured data, security testing, automated tests, and deployment verification.

### Phase 0 cleanup completed

- Removed imports and route mounts for backend files that do not exist in the repository, so the server no longer references phantom modules.
- Removed the fake frontend business fallback. Business identity must come from configured API data.
- Removed the `salePrice` compatibility path. `discountPrice` is the single canonical product discount field.
- Corrected the product-detail frontend API contract to use `GET /api/products/:idOrSlug`.
- Removed the unused duplicate `/catalog` page; `/products` is the canonical public catalogue.
- Removed hardcoded tenant fallback from analytics and switched browser session IDs to `crypto.randomUUID()`.
- Replaced stale completion claims with the actual project status.

## Environment

### Backend

Required environment values are deployment-specific. See `backend/.env.example` if present.

### Frontend

`frontend/.env.example` should define:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
NEXT_PUBLIC_BUSINESS_SLUG=bilal-electronics
```

The business slug is configuration, not a code-level fallback.

## Development

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Important

The seed data is for development/testing only. Production business information, products, media, branding, installment rules, and customer data must be managed through the application and database.
